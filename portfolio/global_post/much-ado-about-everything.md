Much Ado About Everything  
[ROMANIA](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/6CQMWMFH_MhtuJNIHQGoQA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpPUThP0RlaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvNHQ5M25ybTFoaC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1tMG5nenFiZWl6JmxoX2VtPWFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3MlNDBnbWFpbC5jb21XA3NwY0IKZ1Xiv1pnenF871IaYW50aGkubGlraXRzYWtvc0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAFo~)  
Romanian pro-European Union parties said they are coming together to
head off any future bid from the far right, following the victory of the
far-right candidate in a recent election that was invalidated by the
country's high court because of irregularities, setting off massive
upheaval in the EU member state, the Guardian
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/6qEsqI0WwkV8zOpqGVedFA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpPUThP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvbWYycnR2Zmx0Ni8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1tMG5nenFiZWl6VwNzcGNCCmdV4r9aZ3pxfO9SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The parties, which include the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the
center-right National Liberal Party (PNL), the opposition centrist Save
Romania Union (USR), and the ethnic Hungarian party UDMR, said on
Tuesday they would create a coalition government and field one candidate
in new presidential elections expected early next year.  
In legislative elections on Dec. 1, the PSD won the most parliamentary
seats but were closely followed by three far-right, ultranationalist
parties, all holding pro-Russia positions, which together garnered more
than a third of the vote.  
A week before, however, Călin Georgescu, an ultranationalist
independent, shocked the country by winning the first round of the
presidential elections. Georgescu's success drew accusations of foreign
interference -- specifically, Russian interference.  
As a result, Romania's constitutional court annulled the presidential
first round last Friday two days before the runoff, ruling that it was
"marred ... by multiple irregularities and violations of electoral
legislation." Georgescu was set to face the pro-European USR leader
Elena Lasconi in the second round. It is unclear now if he will be able
to run in the do-over vote with prosecutors still investigating his
campaign.  
Intelligence documents that were released ahead of the annulment
included information about cyberattacks and a "massive" campaign of
thousands of social media accounts, implicating Georgescu with links to
Moscow. The evidence suggested that the far-right candidate was promoted
on TikTok through coordinated accounts, altered algorithms, and paid
promotion, reported the Guardian.  
The new administration of the center-left coalition is expected to set
the new dates for the first and second rounds shortly. Klaus Iohannis,
the outgoing president, will serve as interim head of state until the
elections are over and will nominate a new prime minister.  
The outcome of Romania's general and presidential elections are crucial
to deciding its future direction, especially as it concerns the EU and
NATO -- the country holds membership in both blocs.  
Since the election, there have been nationwide protests over the
far-right candidate's victory and the alleged foreign interference,
while Moscow has denied meddling in the elections.  
Meanwhile, last weekend, Romanian police stopped 20 people headed to the
capital of Bucharest in vehicles containing weapons, with officials
saying this group planned to disrupt the protests against Georgescu.
Among those taken in for questioning was the former leader of a
mercenary group operating in Africa and local political figure, Horaţiu
Potra, who allegedly has links to Georgescu,

to Politico.  
The group had planned to initiate an "intimidation operation" targeting
politicians and journalists, officials said.
