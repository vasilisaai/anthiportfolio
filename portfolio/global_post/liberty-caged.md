China escalated its attempt to suppress political dissent in Hong Kong
this week, jailing dozens of pro-democracy activists for as long as a
decade, sparking outrage on the island and internationally, the Guardian
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/xnAqc11drwfDIJTRWB01bA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpIZVjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcWY2N2FjaWJzMS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1uYTJxcTZ5eWIwVwNzcGNCCmc7ZBA_Z--EfpJSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
On Tuesday, a court sentenced 45 pro-democracy activists, which included
former legislators and academics, who were part of the group known as
Hong Kong 47, to jail terms ranging from two months to 10 years.  
The Hong Kong 47 had been arrested in 2021 for their participation in an
unofficial primary election that was held in July 2020, under the city's
national security law (NSL) that was imposed by Beijing in response to
pro-democracy protests the year before. More than 600,000 people voted
in the unofficial election.  
Joshua Wong, a student leader from the 2014 Umbrella movement who was
once the most recognizable face of the pro-democracy movement, was
sentenced to four years and eight months after pleading guilty. Benny
Tai, an academic, was sentenced to 10 years because of his role as
organizer of the primaries, the longest sentence given so for violating
the NSL.  
The trial was overseen by three government-picked judges and no jury due
to the provisions of the NSL, which critics have deemed punitive, noted
the Guardian.  
Simultaneously, Jimmy Lai, the media tycoon behind the tabloid "Apple
Daily," which is a regular target of China's ire, is also battling
charges of foreign collusion under the NSL and an additional charge of
sedition. He is facing life in prison,

to CNN.  
Lai,77, was arrested in 2020 and pleaded not guilty to the charges in
January. On Wednesday, taking a stand at his trial, Lai said he never
tried to influence foreign policy, never advocated for independence or
asked foreign officials to take concrete action on Hong Kong.  
Western countries and rights groups have demanded Lai's release from
solitary confinement, due to concerns for his health.  
For human rights groups and Western nations, these two cases under the
NSL highlight the steep decline in civil liberties such as freedom of
speech, assembly and political participation in Hong Kong over the past
five years.  
Officials in Hong Kong and Beijing have rejected the criticism, saying
that Lai is a "political tool of foreign forces trying to curb China
through Hong Kong" and that "no one should be allowed to use democracy
as a pretext to escape (the) law."
