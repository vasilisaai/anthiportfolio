Fists and Bullets  
[BOLIVIA] 
Former Bolivian President Evo Morales accused the government of
incumbent President Luis Arce of attempting to assassinate him Sunday,
further heightening tensions in the country that were already running
high as a result of a feud between the current leader and his popular
predecessor, Bloomberg

Morales said he was heading to a radio station in Cochabamba in central
Bolivia, where he hosts his weekend radio show, when two vehicles
intercepted his car and "four hooded officers dressed in black with
weapons in their hands got out and began to shoot," CNN

Morales claimed that fourteen bullets hit his car, injuring his driver,
and missing him by "centimeters." A video Morales posted on social media
appeared to show at least two bullet holes in the car's windshield,

to BBC News.  
Morales blames the government for the attack, specifically blaming Arce
and two government ministers, according to his Instagram account.  
In a statement on X, Arce condemned political violence, denied the
government's involvement and ordered an "immediate and thorough
investigation" of the shooting including the possibility of a
"self-attack" staged by Morales.  
Tensions between Morales and Arce have been simmering in the South
American country over the past year, leading to regular protests,
violent clashes with police, blockades of major roads and a [coup

this summer.  
Both men belong to the governing Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party.
But their relationship became acrimonious after both announced their
intention to run as the MAS party's candidate in the 2025 presidential
election.  
Morales, who was president from 2006 to 2019 when he resigned following
allegations of vote-rigging, is facing multiple investigations including
for statutory rape and human trafficking, allegations which he says are
politically motivated.
