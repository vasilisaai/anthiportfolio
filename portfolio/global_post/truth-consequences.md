Truth & Consequences  
[HUNGARY](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/8_kqD-4ettQEvMlpoDkc2g~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo5jPTP0RlaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvd2Fsbm0zMzJyOC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05ZjRlYmh6cDU4JmxoX2VtPWFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3MlNDBnbWFpbC5jb21XA3NwY0IKZvjVrgNnEd1OXFIaYW50aGkubGlraXRzYWtvc0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAFo~)  
Thousands of people protested outside the headquarters of Hungary's
public media corporation over the weekend to denounce state-controlled
media for being a "propaganda factory" for the government of nationalist
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at taxpayers' expense, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/lSQjPvt8FtYXJG2-RmKMiA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo5jPTP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvOThkNWIwa2UwOC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05ZjRlYmh6cDU4VwNzcGNCCmb41a4DZxHdTlxSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The opposition-led demonstrations demanded the dismantling of the
state-controlled media firm and the public media director be fired.
Protest organizer and opposition figure Peter Magyar criticized the
government-run media for its lies and propaganda, calling it "a global
scandal."  
Demonstrators also called for the restoration of genuine public media,
legal prohibitions on government propaganda and the resignation of news
directors accused of falsifying information.  
Since taking power in 2010, Orbán has increasingly cracked down on media
freedoms in Hungary. Critics at home and abroad have complained that the
ruling Fidesz party has used media buyouts by government-connected
business magnates to build a pro-government media empire.  
According to Reporters Without Borders, Orbán's party controls around 80
percent of Hungary's media market resources. The international group
also put the Hungarian leader on its list of media "predators," the
first European Union leader to earn that label.  
The long-serving prime minister and his administration have also come
under EU scrutiny over alleged attacks on the rule of law and
accusations of corruption, Radio Free Europe

Observers said the demonstrations also highlight the increasing
prominence of Magyar and his fledgling TISZA party, adding that the
opposition figure is posing a serious challenge to Orbán.  
TISZA secured nearly 30 percent of the vote in the European Parliament
elections this summer and is polling within a few points of Fidesz.
