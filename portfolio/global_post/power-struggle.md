Power Struggle
BOLIVIA
Violence broke out in Bolivia during a march in support of popular
former President Evo Morales after counter-protesters blocked the route,
underscoring an escalating power struggle in the country, Al Jazeera
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/yExMiOpgOaYhzi8HNS8FaA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRoznjWP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZHdtOHlwZGMyZy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD10cHFkY3FpbnM3VwNzcGNCCmbr2PPrZjZKfT5SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Morales mobilized his supporters for a week-long, 118-mile "March to
Save Bolivia," starting in the small village of Caracollo and ending in
the capital, La Paz, after the current president, Luis Arce, accused him
on national television of orchestrating a coup.  
Morales and around 10,000 supporters attended the march, including
farmers, miners and Indigenous Bolivians, the leftist leader's
traditional base. Morales resigned in 2019, following mass protests that
resulted in 36 deaths over his disputed reelection for a third term,
which was deemed unconstitutional.  
The trek began peacefully but turned violent when counter-protestors
blocked the route, deploying tear gas, stones and firecrackers. The
pro-Morales camp protestors fought back, using slingshots to target the
counter-protesters,

to the Associated Press.  
About 13 people were injured in the violence, including three police
officers. Morales blamed the current administration for the violence,
saying it had sent undercover police officers to instigate it. The
government denied the charge.  
Arce and Morales lead different factions of the Movement for Socialism
Party (MAS), the dominant political party in Bolivia. Morales was
previously Arce's mentor and appointed him as economy minister,
supporting his candidacy in the 2020 elections while he was in exile in
Argentina.  
However, the relationship between the two turned sour when Morales
returned to Bolivia, seeking to regain power. Arce's time in office has
been marked by a lack of political unity, a divided Congress, a
worsening economic crisis and an [alleged coup

by the military.  
Meanwhile, Morales says he will run again in the 2025 elections.
