Thai Do

Hundreds of same-sex couples got married in Thailand on Thursday after
the country became the first in Southeast Asia to recognize marriage
equality in a landmark bill, CNN
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/fXLisZVkf8Vn2Ubok77Yvw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpdfViP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvMzk2ZHhlNnljdi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1vOTR4djF2NGQxVwNzcGNCCmeOYnCTZ_mWAT9SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The new legislation, passed by parliament in June, allows same-sex
couples to register their marriage with full legal, financial, medical,
adoption, and inheritance rights.  
Celebrations erupted nationwide and a mass wedding took place at the
Siam Paragon shopping center in Bangkok on Thursday. The event was
organized with Bangkok Pride and local authorities, and at least 200
couples signed up to get married.  
The bill was written into law by Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn
following decades of campaigning from activists. The fight for marriage
equality in Thailand, despite the country's social openness to the LGBTQ
community, has been hindered by the turbulent political scene, including
a military coup in 2014,

to NPR.  
This new bill ensured equal rights for same-sex couples in bureaucratic
processes such as adoption procedures and marriage visas, helping to
reunite families and strengthen their legal and social standing.  
"This marriage equality law marks the beginning of Thai society's
greater awareness of gender diversity, and our embrace of everyone
regardless of sexual orientation, race, or religion -- our affirmation
that everyone is entitled to equal rights and dignity," Prime Minister
Paetongtarn Shinawatra said in a recorded message that was played at the
event.  
Despite the win for the LGBTQ community, analysts say Thailand may be
the last Asian jurisdiction to recognize same-sex marriage for a while.
Thailand is also the third in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage,
according to CNN.  
And in Thailand, there are limits to the social acceptance of the
community. Last February, the Thai parliament rejected a proposed gender
recognition bill.  
Activists want to get it back on the political agenda to help recognize
an estimated 314,000 trans people in the country,
