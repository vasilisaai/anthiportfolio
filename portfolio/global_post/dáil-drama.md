Dáil Drama  
[IRELAND]
[Michel Martin](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/aL1Jhl8qTIY_7cnXjrMUeQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpdKPjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZHo0bHJlNGZnYS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD00M2hkZGRiaHpiVwNzcGNCCmeO4x6SZ_tkOTNSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
is set to become Ireland's prime minister for the second time after
lawmakers formally approve him as head of a coalition government on

In a parliamentary election at the end of November, Martin's Fianna Fáil
party won the most seats, but not enough to govern alone,
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/vfmLurrfaqnKPIpCRAIT9g~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpdKPjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvYzlkOHV5cjJrMC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD00M2hkZGRiaHpiVwNzcGNCCmeO4x6SZ_tkOTNSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to ABC News. Afterward, the long-dominant center-right parties, Fianna
Fáil and Fine Gael, agreed to form a coalition following weeks of
talks.  
Martin, a veteran politician, is slated to become the taoiseach, or
prime minister, for three years, with outgoing taoiseach Simon Harris
from the Fine Gael party as his deputy. Afterward, the two politicians
will swap positions for the rest of the five-year term.  
Members of both political parties have ratified the agreement, and
Martin was set to be confirmed by members of Dáil, the parliament's
lower house, on Wednesday. President Michael D. Higgins was scheduled to
formally appoint him to the office, and Martin was set to appoint his
cabinet in the early evening.  
However, the Dáil was suspended until Thursday, after the usually
ceremonial appointment process was delayed by protests in the parliament
by opposition parties.  
Opposition parties Sinn Féin and Labour protested over attempts by
independent lawmakers, who are propping up the government, remaining on
opposition benches and eating up critical speaking time.  
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the situation was "completely
unacceptable,"
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/memt9OR-mEQqFNOEcF7kFg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpdKPjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZjcwZGt3Y2dvdi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD00M2hkZGRiaHpiVwNzcGNCCmeO4x6SZ_tkOTNSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to the Guardian. The Dáil speaker, Verona Murphy, was forced to suspend
proceedings twice, before adjourning the lower house until Thursday
morning.  
In the election on Nov. 29, Fianna Fáil won 48 of the 174 legislative
seats and Fine Gael won 38.  
While the two parties share similar center-right policies, they face a
rivalry dating back to Ireland's civil war in the 1920s where they were
on opposing sides. After the indecisive February election of 2020, Fine
Gael and Fianna Fáil entered into an unprecedented coalition government
and Martin became taoiseach for the first time.  
The forming of their new coalition shuts out the opposition center-left
party Sinn Féin, who won 39 seats, more than Fine Gael. The center-right
parties have refused to work with Sinn Féin because of their historic
ties with the Irish Republican Army during decades of violence in
Northern Ireland.
