Kenyan lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to impeach Vice President Rigathi
Gachagua this week over allegations of corruption, heightening political
tensions with the Kenyan president, William Ruto, the BBC
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/yqjnwXwMotDoLrIFCXLEjQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo6ihVP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsveWN4Nm5jM2w4di8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD0ybGlmY3FvejVyVwNzcGNCCmcFVqMHZ2_TL1pSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Gachagua has been accused of acquiring properties worth \$40 million
through corrupt means. The wealthy businessman has denied the charges
and has said that most of the houses and land in question belonged to
his late brother's estate.  
The deputy is also under fire for allegedly supporting anti-government
protests and practicing ethnically divisive politics,

to Deutsche Welle.  
Gachagua, as Ruto's running mate in the 2022 election, helped him secure
a large block of votes from central Kenya. At the time, Gachagua also
battled corruption allegations.  
Local media also reported a growing political rift between Ruto and
Gachagua in recent months.  
Political alliances shifted after Ruto dismissed most of his cabinet,
replacing them with members of the main opposition party following
violent mass protests against unpopular tax increases this summer.  
Last month, police summoned a number of lawmakers allied with the vice
president to answer charges involving their alleged funding of the
protests in June.  
Gachagua is the first Kenyan deputy to be impeached by the lower house
of the legislature. The upper chamber will now decide on his
impeachment,

Meanwhile, the vice president plans to challenge the impeachment in
court,

to the Associated Press. He has also warned that his removal from office
would ignite discontent among his supporters and among his tribe, the
largest in the country.  
President Ruto has yet to comment publicly on the matter.
