Police in China's biggest cities are cracking down on Halloween
festivities this year, clearing streets of partygoers and interrogating
costume choices, fearing that the holiday has become a sign of youth
dissatisfaction with the government, NBC News
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/Hegcx_xMotG3CZsy69RRpw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpBdfUP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvN253ejE4YTczYy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1kb3h5NjFwNmZyVwNzcGNCCmcS1lIjZ_POW0hSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The crackdown on Halloween follows unusually lively and large
celebrations in Shanghai last year following the lifting of a three-year
Covid-19 lockdown. Many young people used Halloween as a political
outlet for political and social criticism, the news outlet said.  
For example, some dressed up as Covid-19 test administrators to mock the
lockdown, while others covered themselves in job advertisements to
highlight weak employment opportunities in the country,

to France24.  
But this year, the government, fearing another display of mockery and
criticism, decided to quash the revelries.  
Although formal restrictions on gatherings were not announced, Shanghai
police vans last weekend lined up in popular streets like Julu Road that
had hosted celebrations the previous year, with police questioning
people in costume and checking IDs.  
Videos on social media surfaced from another city, Hangzhou, showing
costumed people being escorted away by police. Halloween events in the
capital, Beijing, were also canceled.  
The Chinese Communist Party has long subjected the Chinese to sweeping
restrictions on cultural expression and political dissent, and is
particularly wary of "Western" ideals, like the notion of Halloween,
which officials fear will erode political loyalty among the young.
