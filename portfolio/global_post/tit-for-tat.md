Turkey launched airstrikes on Syria and Iraq Thursday, targeting
suspected Kurdish militants based there whom it blames for a deadly
attack on the headquarters of its national aerospace company earlier
this week, the Guardian
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/qyzBFzixEobe5l-_dVZcmg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo_e7TP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvd3Y0ZWNiY3R1MS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD13aG56a2txcmN1VwNzcGNCCmcS1WkbZ_6LX-9SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The country's National Intelligence Organization said its strikes
targeted numerous "strategic locations" used by the Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK) or the affiliated Syrian Kurdish militia, with targets
including military, intelligence, ammunition, and energy and
infrastructure facilities.  
Turkey suspects the PKK was behind the violent attack on the Turkish
Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) headquarters on the outskirts of the
capital Ankara that killed five people and injured 22 others Wednesday,

CNN.  
The attack involved a man and a woman armed with assault rifles, who
arrived at the headquarters in a taxi after killing its driver. The pair
ignited explosives and opened fire at the facility, killing four more
people. The two assailants were killed after security teams were
dispatched to the location.  
Turkey's retaliation for the "terror attack" killed 12 civilians,
including two children, and wounded 25 others, in northern and eastern
Syria.  
"In addition to populated areas, Turkish warplanes and UAVs (drones)
targeted bakeries, power stations, oil facilities and (Kurdish) Internal
Security Force checkpoints," the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Defense
Force said in a statement on Thursday. Similar airstrikes also occurred
in northern Iraq, with 30 targets being destroyed in the aerial
offensive, the Turkish defense ministry reported.  
TUSAS manufactures defense industry systems, and its technology is
credited with giving Turkey the upper hand in its battle against the
Kurds.  
The attack on TUSAS came a day after the head of a far-right nationalist
party in Turkey (MHP), Devlet Bahçeli, raised the possibility of
granting the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Öcalan, parole if he
renounced violence and disbanded the PKK.  
This unexpected announcement came as Bahçeli's ally, President Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan, is seeking political support from the pro-Kurdish
Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM),

to Euronews. Erdoğan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister
and later president, needs to implement constitutional changes to run
for office again.  
The PKK, considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies,
has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since the
1980s, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people.
