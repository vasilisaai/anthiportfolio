Dirty Hands  
SINGAPORE
Singapore's former Transport Minister S. Iswaran pled guilty on Tuesday
to illegally receiving gifts while in office, in a landmark case that
has rocked the Southeast Asian financial hub which prides itself on its
clean governance and transparency, the Financial Times
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/AsyX1D5KCP73CCbAeotC5A~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo1mHXP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvdmdiNGVuejRlcS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1zbDRiZjU0eGQxVwNzcGNCCmbr2NzzZgSDRXVSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The case against Iswaran began earlier this year, when prosecutors
charged him with 35 felonies, including receiving gifts with a total
value of more than \$312,000 from local businessmen during his term in
office.  
He initially denied the allegations and vowed to clear his name. But
prosecutors ultimately proceeded with only five of the charges, all of
which he pled guilty to. The remaining 30 charges will be taken into
consideration during his sentencing next month.  
Iswaran could now face a fine or up to two years in jail for each
charge,

to the BBC. His lawyers are demanding no more than eight weeks.  
The former official is known for bringing the Formula 1 Grand Prix to
the city-state and played a key role in developing Singapore's tourism
landscape since the late 2000s.  
The case shocked the public in a country known for being one of the
least corrupt in the world and for having some of the highest-paid
officials anywhere, with some ministers earning about \$758,000 a
year.  
Singaporean officials say such salaries are aimed at discouraging
corruption.  
Before this case, the last time a politician faced corruption charges
was in 1986, when authorities investigated then-National Development
Minister Teh Cheang Wan for accepting bribes. He committed suicide
before he could be charged.  
Analysts said the case comes at a difficult time for the ruling People's
Action Party (PAP), which has governed Singapore since its independence
in 1965 and long touted its strong stance against corruption and amoral
behavior.  
The country is set to hold elections next year and while the PAP is
likely to win again, it has come under scrutiny over a series of
scandals, including a corruption probe against two other ministers last
year and the resignation of two lawmakers over an extramarital affair.
