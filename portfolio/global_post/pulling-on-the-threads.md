One person was shot dead and at least 20 others were injured in violent
clashes between protesting garment workers and police in Bangladesh on
Monday, rocking the country just a few months after its longtime
autocratic leader was deposed in a revolution, Reuters
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/HGbhZtVUG2XXa8jUraQgUg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo35xWP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZnlnajdjc2tzdy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD0wNDlvdzJyNWNpVwNzcGNCCmb4Vxf9ZiELMRNSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The violence erupted when protestors blocked a major highway on the
outskirts of the capital Dhaka, demanding higher wages and improved
working conditions in clothing factories, hurling bricks at law
enforcement officers and their vehicles.  
The widespread protests, which have been going on for weeks, have led to
the closures of dozens of factories in one of the world's largest
clothing production hubs.  
Bangladesh is the world's third-largest clothing exporter, behind China
and the European Union, with its factories producing clothing for top
European brands such as Zara and H&M. More than 80 percent of the
country's export earnings are produced in the garment industry, Reuters
noted.  
The protests of factory workers in recent weeks, along with recent
floods and political turmoil, have resulted in a backlog of
production.  
Garment industry leaders, worried that brands will move their production
elsewhere, have addressed most of the protestors' demands and called on
the government to increase security measures to continue operations.  
The interim government, meanwhile, has formed a committee to address the
demonstrators' concerns while labor leaders have urged for factory-based
talks to calm the unrest.  
This is not the first time garment workers in Bangladesh have tried to
secure a pay hike or better working conditions. Four garment workers
died in protests against the low national minimum wage last fall,

to Amnesty International.  
"Most garment workers are still fighting for decent wages in an industry
that brings the most revenue to Bangladesh and paying a heavy price for
fighting for their rights," said Nadia Rahman, Amnesty's South Asia
regional director.  
Amnesty added that unlawful force has been used by police against
protesting garment workers.  
The current unrest comes at a time when an interim government, led by
Muhammad Yunus, has taken over the country after massive student-led
protests forced longtime autocratic leader, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, to flee the country. More than 1,000 people died in the
protests,

The interim government has been tasked with maintaining stability and
organizing parliamentary elections.
