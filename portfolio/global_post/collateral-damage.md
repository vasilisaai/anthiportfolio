Collateral Damage  
[LEBANON](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/W-WBYVqzwuRe3-GWzu3s2g~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpIubmP0RlaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvMmtpOHBheTNpci8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD01OHZicWhpczJ0JmxoX2VtPWFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3MlNDBnbWFpbC5jb21XA3NwY0IKZz_mYUBnkToAb1IaYW50aGkubGlraXRzYWtvc0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAFo~)  
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) held an "extraordinary session" in Paris this week focusing on
protecting world heritage sites in Lebanon following growing concern
from prominent archeologists, academics, and Lebanese officials about
their destruction from intensifying Israeli strikes, Art Forum

During the meetings, UNESCO officials said they will add 34 Lebanese
cultural properties to the International List of Cultural Property under
Enhanced Protection and provide funding and technical assistance to
ensure the security of the sites, which have "outstanding value to
humanity,"
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/7Ee3WFtK_1f6HjGZZJMuKQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpIubmP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvN3o2NDJ6Zm5qbS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD01OHZicWhpczJ0VwNzcGNCCmc_5mFAZ5E6AG9SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to UNESCO.  
As a result, these sites will receive "immunity against attack and use
for military purposes," according to UNESCO. Non-compliance would
constitute "serious violations" of the 1954 Hague Convention on cultural
heritage in conflict and could lead to prosecution.  
For more than two millennia, the Roman temples and other structures at
Baalbek in eastern Lebanon have stood as some of the finest examples of
Roman architecture anywhere in the world, the BBC

But earlier this month, a car park just a few feet away from the UNESCO
World Heritage site was hit by an Israeli air strike.  
The strike, which left the Roman temples and other structures untouched
but destroyed a centuries-old Ottoman building, highlighted what
archaeologists say is the risk of irreparable damage to historical sites
across Lebanon. That's because the war between Israel and Hezbollah,
which intensified starting in September, has moved beyond the targeting
of southern Lebanon, Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley, traditionally
Hezbollah strongholds, to threaten Baalbek and other areas.  
That has set off panic among archeologists.  
"Baalbek is the major Roman site in Lebanon -- you couldn't replace it
if someone bombed it," Graham Philip, an archaeology professor at Durham
University in the UK, told the BBC. "It would be a huge loss. It would
be a crime."  
Another site at risk is Tyre, a major port of the Phoenician Empire
around 2,500 years ago, which also hosts Roman ruins. It has been a
[target](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/4TizYBSjhpAPRYuNM2WIJQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpIubmP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZ3E1ZGV2aWRpcS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD01OHZicWhpczJ0VwNzcGNCCmc_5mFAZ5E6AG9SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
of airstrikes repeatedly in the past few weeks.  
UNESCO hopes that this move not only enshrines the protection of the
sites but also "helps send a signal to the entire international
community of the urgent need to protect these sites,"
