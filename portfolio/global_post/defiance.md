Defiance  
[MARTINIQUE] 
France deployed a long-banned anti-riot force to Martinique to help
local authorities suppress protests over the skyrocketing price of food,
with demonstrators accusing the central government of treating its
region like a colony, Radio France Internationale
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/Y3lR6WdluGCclyZL--hwzA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo1RBXP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZHU1YTE2ZXdmMy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD10NTdxZno4YjR2VwNzcGNCCmbrWYvyZjZOFGtSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The protests, which broke out in early September on the French Caribbean
Island, have left 14 injured, including 11 police officers, and have
been marked by gunfire, tear gas and looting.  
Over the weekend, France's local representatives instituted a nightly
curfew and a ban on demonstrations in certain parts of the capital.
After these restrictions were defied by thousands on the island taking
to the streets in peaceful marches, an elite riot unit from France was
deployed, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/de2mHy511Nlva4rw9AZW0A~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo1RBXP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcmtnZml4MTZtYy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD10NTdxZno4YjR2VwNzcGNCCmbrWYvyZjZOFGtSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
That unit, known as the Companies for Republican Security, has been
banned from Martinique for 65 years: During violent riots in 1959 in the
territory, it was accused of using disproportionate force on protestors
resulting in the deaths of young demonstrators.  
The protesters now say they want the government to address soaring food
prices on the island.

to the Guardian, residents of the territory pay an estimated 30 to 42
percent more for food than their counterparts in mainland France, but
have nowhere near comparable wealth.  
Last year, Gérald Darmanin, France's interior minister, had pledged to
tackle price-gouging by companies and anti-competitive practices such as
monopolies that he said contributed to the high costs. However,
demonstrators said that authorities and businesses have failed to do so
or address any concerns effectively.

consulate in Martinique, told the Guardian that many residents believe
that the way France governs Martinique is inequitable: "In a
majority-Black country, all of the people who hold the highest positions
here ... are from (mainland) France," he said, adding that the local
White population "wield most of the economic power in Martinique."
