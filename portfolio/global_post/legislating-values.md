​​Legislating Values  
RUSSIA
Russia's lower house of parliament on Wednesday approved the first
reading of a bill that would ban the adoption of Russian children by
citizens from countries that allow gender transition, the latest effort
by the government to promote and protect "traditional family values,"

Under the ban, parents from countries where gender transitioning is
legal, including a number of Western nations, such as Canada, Austria,
Spain and Switzerland, won't be eligible to adopt Russian children.  
The proposed law comes a year after Russia banned surgical operations
"aimed at changing the sex of a person" and the changing of gender on
documents. Separately, the country's supreme court also ruled in favor
of a ban of the non-existent "International Public LGBT Movement" in
November 2023.  
Meanwhile, the bill is the latest in a series of legislation targeting
the LGBTQ community that has taken effect in the past year.  
In July 2023, President Vladimir Putin -- who portrays himself as a
champion of what he describes as traditional values -- signed into law a
ban on gender-reassignment surgery and hormone therapy done as part of
the gender transition process.  
That same year, other legislation targeting "Western anti-family
ideology" voided marriages if one partner had "changed gender", and
prohibited transgender individuals from adopting children.  
Along with Wednesday's ban, lawmakers are also discussing a proposal to
criminalize individuals promoting a "child-free" lifestyle, Newsweek

The draft law is aimed at "preserving and strengthening Russian
spiritual and moral values."  
Some lawmakers warned of groups on social media promoting a "child-free"
lifestyle that disrespect parenthood and undermine the family, which
they consider as the "basis of a strong state."  
Penalties for violating the law include fines of up to \$4,300 for
individuals, more than \$8,600 for state officials, and at least
\$53,700 for companies.  
However, critics described the law as dystopian and expressed concern
about further state control over personal choices, such as the
government introducing a "tax on childlessness" or penalties for
infertility.  
Observers noted that the bills and initiatives by Russian authorities to
uphold "traditional family values" are really an effort to encourage
citizens to have more children.  
Russia's birth rate has dropped to its lowest level in 25 years,
exacerbated by casualties from the war in Ukraine and emigration.
