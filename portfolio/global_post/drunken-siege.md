Eighteen assailants and one presidential guard died during an attack on
the presidential complex of Chad amidst political turmoil in the central
African nation,

to the Guardian.  
Officials said 24 assailants attempted to storm the presidential palace
in Chad's capital N'Djamena armed with knives and machetes Wednesday
evening. The "destabilization attempt" happened while President Mahamat
Déby Itno was inside, said Foreign Affairs Minister Abderaman
Koulamallah.  
The attackers arrived at the complex in a few vehicles and stabbed the
four entrance guards, killing one and injuring two. Following, they then
walked into the presidency where other guards shot at them, killing 18
and detaining six others, reported the Guardian.  
Following the attack, rumors spread online that the attack could be
traced back to the Islamic militant group Boko Haram which launched an
insurgency against Western education more than a decade ago,

to the Associated Press.  
The group has sought to establish Islamic law in Nigeria's northeast,
and the insurgency has spread to neighboring West African countries such
as Chad.  
Even so, Koulamallah said that the assault was probably not a terrorist
attack, as the attackers were local youths from N'Djamena, reported the
wire. He also referred to the attackers as drunk "[Pieds

referring to a French comic featuring unlucky crooks.  
The attack came a week after parliamentary elections that were boycotted
by the main opposition party, Les Transformateurs.  
Chad has been grappling with a period of political turmoil before and
after the controversial May presidential elections that resulted in a
win for Déby Itno, who led the country as interim president during a
period of military rule that followed his father's death.  
His father, Idriss Déby Itno, had ruled Chad since a military coup in
the early 1990s but was killed by rebels in 2021.  
In November, Chad also ended a defense cooperation agreement with
France, leading to the withdrawal of 1,000 French military personnel.
The pact with France had made Chad an important actor in the fight
against Islamic militants in the Sahel.
