Tens of thousands of Greeks protested across the country on Sunday to
demand justice for the 57 people who died in Greece's worst rail
disaster two years ago, the Associated Press

The protests, breaking out in more than 100 cities in the southeast
European country, were some of the largest Greece has seen in recent
years,

to Reuters. Brief clashes broke out between the police and some
protesters, with the officers using tear gas to break up the crowds.  
Protesters held banners reading, "I have no oxygen," which were a
woman's last words in a call to emergency services during the 2023 train
collision. It was previously thought that all of the victims had died on
impact. The chilling audio of her call was released by local media last
week, sparking the current wave of protests.  
The February 2023 crash happened on a line linking Athens with Greece's
second-largest city Thessaloniki, where a freight train and a passenger
train packed with students crashed head-on just before midnight.  
Soon afterward, thousands of Greeks took to the streets to demonstrate
against alleged government neglect regarding the maintenance of the rail
network, the country then still amid a decade-long financial crisis.  
Following the release of the recording, many speculated that dozens of
the victims might have died in a fire following the crash. A judicial
investigation is still underway and the causes of the deaths of many of
the victims have still not been determined, Euronews

The families of the victims have accused the authorities of trying to
cover up evidence and pinning the blame solely on the stationmaster, as
deflecting their responsibility.  
The government has denied those allegations.
