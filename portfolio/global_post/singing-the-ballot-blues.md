More than 30 people have been killed in Mozambique in one week, raising
the death toll to 110 in the government's bloody crackdown on protestors
following a disputed election in October, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/SMxD4MCvATs0YntonU3hhw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpPpZkP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZmUyYnBvaXJnay8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1iZHhrN2R4eXNpVwNzcGNCCmdVZRFcZ3oISbZSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Over the past two months, thousands of people in the southern African
nation have taken to the streets of the capital Maputo, and elsewhere in
protests against the governing Frelimo party, which has run the country
since independence from Portugal in 1975.  
Initially peaceful, the protests turned violent after police fired into
the crowds. As a result, angry demonstrators have attacked police
stations, courthouses, and Frelimo party offices, and even blocked the
main border crossing with South Africa.  
The protestors believe that the elections were rigged.  
However, following the vote on Oct. 9, the electoral commission said the
Frelimo party candidate, Daniel Chapo, won 71 percent of the vote.  
International observers disagree, saying the ballot was marred by
irregularities,

to the Economist. The independent candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, who won
only 20 percent of the vote, has claimed that he is the true winner and
has called for a revolution.  
Mondlane, a leaning populist part-time pastor, has garnered support from
young people in cities, influencing protests from exile abroad through
Facebook broadcasts.  
Now, countries around the world are concerned about the ongoing unrest
and violence: Amnesty International
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/PGE-VP1G42gV3PInyVp7dQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpPpZkP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvc2hhZ2M1ZGlqdi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1iZHhrN2R4eXNpVwNzcGNCCmdVZRFcZ3oISbZSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
that police have shot at least 329 people since the eruption of the
protests, killing 110, including children and bystanders, and arrested
more than 3,500 people arbitrarily.  
Tensions rose when two prominent opposition officials were fatally shot
in their car by unknown gunmen on Oct. 18, escalating the protests.  
Meanwhile, Chapo is due to be inaugurated on Jan.15, but the election
results have not been validated by the Constitutional Council due to
legal challenges from the opposition. The protests are expected to
escalate later this month.
