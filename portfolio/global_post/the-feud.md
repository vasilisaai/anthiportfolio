Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema suspended three constitutional
court judges this week over alleged judicial misconduct, a move that has
drawn criticism from the opposition and accusations of political
interference in the judiciary, the BBC
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/kEI3HuXce4hBPYiWJmCykg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo17NVP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvMXJsZGRncXU5YS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD11NXBpMWVzMGFlVwNzcGNCCmb0Vi71ZqwdNpNSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
On Monday, the president's office announced the suspension of justices
Annie Sitali, Mungeni Mulenga and Palan Mulonda following a two-year
probe by the country's Judicial Complaints Commission (JCC), which also
recommended their suspension.  
The judges will now undergo a disciplinary procedure which will
determine if they will be removed from the bench.  
Observers said the suspension is connected to a long-running feud
between the president and the three justices going back to the 2016
presidential elections.  
At the time, the constitutional court dismissed a petition by Hichilema
-- then a presidential contender -- that challenged the election victory
of former President Edgar Lungu.  
Before the 2016 election, Lungu had appointed the three judges,

The three justices also participated in another ruling that allowed
Lungu to run in the 2021 elections. That decision was controversial
because Zambia's constitution only allows the president to serve two
terms in office.  
Before his full five-year term (2016-2021), Lungu served as Zambia's
president for about a year, following the death of his predecessor
Michael Sata,

to the Conversation.  
While opponents noted that Lungu's candidacy would mean he is running
for a third term, the court disagreed. Regardless, Lungu lost the vote
to Hichilema.  
The three judges have faced previous petitions to dismiss them, but the
JCC had rejected those motions until a private citizen filed a complaint
against the trio.  
The suspension comes at a politically sensitive time: Hichilema and
Lungu are expected to run against each other again in the 2026
elections.  
Meanwhile, analysts said the dismissals came just a few days before the
judges were set to rule on whether Lungu could run in the 2026
elections.  
The move sparked criticism from Lungu and his Patriotic Front party,
which called the decision illegal and asked people to take to the
streets in protest.  
Civil rights advocates also condemned the move as political meddling.  
Zambia's constitution allows the president to appoint judges, including
the chief justice, based on JCC recommendations and parliamentary
approval. Critics have warned that this undermines judicial independence
by giving the president too much control over the selection process.
