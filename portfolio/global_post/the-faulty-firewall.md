Germany's opposition conservatives won parliamentary approval on
Wednesday for a proposal to restrict migration, a vote that stirred
controversy because it breached a "firewall" by working with the
far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Reuters
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/MQ-yMviISBfxUgTF1Mv2vA~~/AASU4xA~/g8gO3naesIK3USCo_VozqISGZKRlHIarYlXHK2j-49dTxNdTyIAoxHYFKp0YrhnITKXwWsBob0hwquNGCbYUIK3NRhAU1WZmUroSGnVkqmbnbcEZB1yPV5KGYs2o-2yagxiH6P73Y38UhyLjVMkN0jHNCdbQLbf-8sMlOI8pvgw~).  
Fredrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
proposed a motion in parliament calling for tougher border controls and
asylum rules, which passed with the support of the AfD, sparking anger
and recriminations among lawmakers across the political aisle.  
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democratic Party
reprimanded Merz for his actions, calling them an "unforgivable
mistake."  
"Since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years
ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats in our
parliaments: We do not make common cause with the far right," he told
the legislature.  
His predecessor, Angela Merkel -- also of the CDU -- criticized Merz's
decision, saying he had said in November that no measures should be
passed with the AfD's support,

Deutsche Welle.  
The importance of the firewall against the far right in the Western
European country's political culture is due to the legacy of the Nazi
party and its responsibility for the Holocaust.  
Many mainstream parties consider it taboo to work with them. Meanwhile,
the German security services are monitoring the AfD on suspicion of
being a right-wing extremist party.  
Even so, the CDU leader defended his actions as "necessary," and now
plans to propose actual legislation on Friday aimed at curbing
immigration numbers and family reunification rights, again with possible
backing from the AfD,

to the BBC.  
The recent controversy comes as Germany heads to parliamentary elections
on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition.  
Merz is the frontrunner for chancellor due to his party's leading
position in the polls. He has pushed for a stricter migration policy
following a series of deadly attacks in recent months by migrants.
