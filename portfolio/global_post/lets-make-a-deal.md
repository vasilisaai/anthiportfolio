Let's Make a Deal  
CHAGOS ISLANDS/MAURITIUS  
A contentious deal for the United Kingdom to cede control of the Chagos
Islands to Mauritius is being challenged by the African island country's
new prime minister, who is now offering his own "counterproposals," Al

The British government has said it still plans to give control of the
chain of the contested Indian Ocean archipelago to Mauritius under the
condition that the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia, and its
strategic joint UK-US military base, remain under British rule for at
least 99 years.  
The initial agreement to transfer sovereignty of the chain of more than
60 islands off the southern tip of India, just below the equator, was
announced in October,
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/vlZrcYXPNWGDHYOxldJj2Q~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpR9DmP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvYXB2NTdsdXEybi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1xaGJmZW1uZGlhVwNzcGNCCmdV50tlZ3EOeJ1SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to the Associated Press.  
When the announcement was made, the UK's governing Labour Party said it
was finalizing the treaty's details with the Mauritian government. Since
then, the government in Mauritius was voted out by voters, and replaced
by one led by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam who took office last
month.  
On Tuesday, Ramgoolam said he was reopening negotiations because the
current deal "would not produce the benefits that the nation could
expect from such an agreement," wrote Al Jazeera.  
Ramgoolam added that his government "is still willing to come to an
agreement with the United Kingdom" and had submitted counterproposals.  
Stephen Doughty, the UK's minister for overseas territories told
lawmakers in the House of Commons on Wednesday that the deal would be
finalized as it was fair and in both countries' best interests.  
Doughty also said that the deal "protects the base at proportionate
cost. It has been supported across the national security architecture in
the United States and by India."  
The UK's Conservative Party has criticized Labour for surrendering
control of the territory that has been under their jurisdiction since
1814 -- despite the negotiations over the Islands that led to this point
having been mostly conducted under the previous Conservative
government.  
In the 1960s and 1970s, the UK forcibly evicted nearly 2,000 local
residents to make way for the military base, which in the years since
has played a pivotal role in US military operations in Vietnam, Iran,
and Afghanistan, and was used for covert rendition flights of terror
suspects.  
The displaced people have fought in British courts for years for the
right to return to their homes. The new agreement would allow them and
their descendants to return to the islands, but not to Diego Garcia.  
US President Joe Biden has praised the agreement as "historic,"
emphasizing the importance of the US Navy base. The base on Diego Garcia
is currently home to around 2,500 American military personnel and has
continued to be a strategic point for security operations in the Middle
East, South Asia, and East Africa.
