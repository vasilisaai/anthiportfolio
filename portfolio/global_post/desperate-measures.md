at the Francesco Ferrari hospital in Casarano.  
After the recorded Foggia attack, the hospital threatened to shut the
emergency room, the Associated Press
[noted](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/rkF1_Xt_K4mTncTJwEtQPQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo1mHXP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvczc2cHc4MmV0NC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1zbDRiZjU0eGQxVwNzcGNCCmbr2NzzZgSDRXVSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
"We have never seen such levels of aggression in the past decade,"
Antonio De Palma, president of the Nursing Up union, told the AP. "We
are now at a point where considering military protection in hospitals is
no longer a far-fetched idea. We cannot wait any longer."  
In Italy, there had been 16,000 reported cases of physical and verbal
assaults on medical staff by patients and their relatives in 2023, the
latest figures available.  
While these attacks have been occurring throughout the entire country,
the frequency of the attacks has been higher in southern Italy, leading
the doctors' guild to request the army be sent to protect staff.  
The reasons behind the attacks have been attributed to understaffing at
hospitals and clinics, and long wait times for procedures that result in
frustration for patients and their relatives.  
At the same time, Italy's salary cap legislation has kept wages low and
nearly half of clinical posts in emergency medicine have remained
unfilled as of 2022. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic worsened the
staffing crisis, with many health professionals emigrating for
opportunities abroad. As a result, Italy is short of around 30,000
doctors.
