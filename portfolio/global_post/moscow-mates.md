Pezeshkian is set to make an official visit to Moscow on Jan. 17, where
the two world leaders will discuss expanding cooperation between the
nations in talks focused on trade, investment, "and current issues on
the regional and international agenda," according to a statement
released by the Kremlin.  
More critically, the talks are to cement the expanding military and
political partnerships between the two countries.  
Moscow's ties with the Iranian regime have intensified since Russia
invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow has also strengthened ties with
other countries hostile to the United States and Europe, such as North
Korea,

to Reuters.  
Putin signed a similar agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in
June, in which both countries agreed to militarily support each other in
the event of an aggression, reported Politico.  
So far, about 300 North Korean soldiers have died fighting in Russia's
war against Ukraine, and around 2,700 troops have been wounded,

to Al-Jazeera.  
The United States accused Iran in September of delivering close-range
ballistic missiles to Russia for use in the war, and imposed sanctions
on companies and ships it suspected were involved in delivering weapons
Iranian weapons.  
Iran had admitted it provided Shahed drones to Russia months before the
Ukraine war but denied the larger involvement or that drones had been
sent following the invasion.
