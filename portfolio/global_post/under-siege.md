Guatemalan authorities raided the compound of an ultra-orthodox Jewish

allegations of child abuse, including rape,

ABC News.  
The farm used by the Lev Tahor community about 55 miles southeast of
Guatemala City was raided by police and the military, who took the women
and children into protective custody, said Interior Minister Francisco
Jiménez.  
Jiménez added that the children were allegedly being abused by a member
of the sect, prompting the search by the authorities.  
In a statement on the social media platform X, the Central American
country's attorney general's office said that bones suspected to be of
one child were found. The office also said that a complaint was filed in
November of possible crimes which included forced pregnancies,
mistreatment of minors, and rape.  
Following the raid, about 100 people from the sect gathered outside
where some tried to take the children back forcibly, the attorney
general's office said.  
The Lev Tahor movement, made up of an estimated 50 families, is under
investigation for serious sexual offenses in several countries where
they reside, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, and
Israel,

the BBC.  
The small sect is known for extremist practices, the news outlet added,
for example advocating for child marriage, inflicting harsh punishments
for minor transgressions, and requiring women and girls as young as
three to cover up with robes.  
After hopping around the glove, much of the sect settled in Mexico and
Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. Members of the community were arrested
in a police operation in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas in 2022
but were later freed due to a lack of evidence.  
Lev Tahor now claims they are facing religious persecution from the
Guatemalan government.  
The Jewish Community of Guatemala has disowned the sect, and expressed
support for the Guatemalan authorities in carrying out necessary
investigations "to protect the lives and integrity of minors and other
vulnerable groups that may be at risk."
