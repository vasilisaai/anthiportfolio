Fits and Starts  
COLOMBIA
The Colombian government suspended peace negotiations with the National
Liberation Army (ELN) following an attack by the rebel group earlier
this week, in what is another setback for leftist President Gustavo
Petro's efforts to end the country's decades-long conflict, Agence
France-Presse
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/fkuT1xQEJn4LZyCfxQMNaA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRoz8pVP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvNXk2amhlcnY2NC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD01bzIwNDBiYzNkVwNzcGNCCmbrV0XtZjqtJpVSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
On Tuesday, authorities accused the ELN of firing rockets from a truck
parked near a military base in the country's eastern Arauca province.
The attack killed two soldiers and injured 29 others.  
The group did not claim responsibility for the attack.  
Even so, Petro said the incident "closes the peace process with blood."
Government negotiators added that the talks have been "suspended" and
can only be restarted if the armed group shows "an unequivocal
demonstration of its desire for peace."  
The attack comes a month after the ELN ended a ceasefire deal it signed
with the Colombian government last year. Although the group has
continued attacks against Colombia's security forces, it was still
involved in peace talks aimed at ending more than 50 years of fighting,
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/cILs2y0360jS-ruZ_BvTVg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRoz8pVP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsveXIwYWE5cjlpdi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD01bzIwNDBiYzNkVwNzcGNCCmbrV0XtZjqtJpVSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to the Associated Press.  
The suspension of negotiations deals another blow to Petro's policy of
"total peace" with the country's rebel groups. Since taking office in
2022, the president has been engaged in peace talks with multiple armed
groups.  
The ELN remains the largest armed group still active in the South
American country since the government signed a peace deal with the much
larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016.  
The deal with FARC was aimed at ending the long-running conflict, but
holdout FARC splinter groups and the ELN have refused to engage in peace
deals.  
Efforts by prior Colombian governments to reach a peace agreement with
the ELN have failed. The armed group is believed to have between 5,800
and 6,000 fighters, and primarily finances itself through
narco-trafficking and illegal gold mines.
