Serbia's prime minister Milos Vučević stepped down Tuesday in an attempt
to calm political tensions following weeks of massive student-led
anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy
in November, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/1PaIW20nBkplieHcfPGIpA~~/AASU4xA~/PUhIgYVCowyDZ5XSwQ5Qs0tIg2UlDxPSGGas2Pw2EFRMX8QSSLuQ8rbnzHdrdBnh2AIzi4q5kh8syJZ_0GLkzcKUQwzHR6pmu53oqKBesr5qum-SY_w5YM1DRIXE8s79FPo3SG6E9RzKVqhK5EbFleRxP5ygU4LphH13iovnQD8~).  
The accident, at a rail station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killed
15 people and sparked protests. Demonstrators initially demanded justice
for the victims amid allegations of corruption in the procurement
process for the canopy. However, after a heavy-handed crackdown on
protesters by the government, the protests broadened with calls for the
autocratic rule of populist President Aleksandar Vučić and his
administration to end.  
"In order not to further raise tensions in society, I made this
decision,"

Vučević, announcing his resignation, even as pressure grows on Vučić,
who has been in power for more than a decade.  
Vučević said the immediate cause for his quitting was an attack on a
female student in Novi Sad early Tuesday by assailants allegedly from
the ruling Serbian Progressive Party.  
Vučević's resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election.  
The protests, which have become a daily event, have shut down
universities, schools, businesses, and roads, and led to strikes. Some
have drawn up to 100,000 people, the largest demonstrations in the
country since those that overthrew longtime ruler Slobodan Milošević in
2000.  
The student-led protests have grown to include lawyers, farmers, and
actors, with much of the public backing them, recent polls showed. The
president has launched counter-protests.  
Meanwhile, on Monday, the striking university students began a 24-hour
blockade of a key traffic intersection in Belgrade, AP

Later Monday, Vučić and other officials said they would initiate talks
with the protesters, who declined.
