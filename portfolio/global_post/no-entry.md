Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini may be facing up to six
years in prison for a 2019 decision that blocked a ship assisting
migrants from docking in Italy, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/ktoSJfbarFgOxekPy8HKjA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRoy9XTP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvdTljZTc4b3NtMi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD03MXNuOHdyaGh2VwNzcGNCCmbh1VDpZoz8aaRSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Salvini is charged with the kidnapping of the migrants on board the ship
and dereliction of duty. A decision in the trial, which began in 2021,
could be made as early as next month. If convicted, Salvini could be
barred from holding public office.  
Salvini has denied the charges. He said on X that "defending Italy is
not a crime and I will not give up, not now, not ever."  
At the time, the ship, operated by the charity Open Arms, was carrying
147 migrants from Libya, and was hoping to dock on the small Italian
island of Lampedusa, halfway between North Africa and mainland Europe.  
Salvini, who was interior minister at the time, adopted a "closed ports"
policy to deter migrants from entering Italy, turning away charity ships
rescuing migrants at sea and accusing humanitarian organizations of
encouraging human trafficking. The ship at the center of the case was
stranded at sea for 19 days before a court order allowed it to dock.  
During the trial, crewmembers have testified that the sanitary
conditions of the migrants on board deteriorated during those 19 days in
limbo, even resulting in a scabies outbreak,

to BBC news.  
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's ruling Brothers of Italy party
is currently in a coalition with Salvini's right-wing League party. She
wrote on X that "turning the duty to protect Italy's borders from
illegal immigration into a crime is a very serious precedent."  
Meanwhile, the verdict will affect not only Salvini, but the rights of
migrants and humanitarian organizations to access Italian ports, the AP
wrote.
