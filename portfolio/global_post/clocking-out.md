A court in Switzerland ruled that a dial manufacturer in the famed Swiss
watchmaking industry was justified in requiring workers to punch out for
bathroom breaks, pitting the rich Alpine country's labor standards
against its reputation for "running like clockwork,"

to the Associated Press.  
An investigative report by the Swiss news outlet RTS this month reported
that a regional court in Neuchâtel in western Switzerland found that
watch company Jean Singer & Cie SA had not violated any rights by making
their employees clock out to use the toilet.  
The requirement became apparent to labor inspectors during an on-site
visit to the company during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. The
inspectors ordered the company to end the practice, alleging that Singer
violated a federal labor law that protects workers' personal needs.  
The labor inspectors claimed the policy could cause employees to "hold
it in or not hydrate, which could lead to serious physiological
disorders."  
The case was decided in June but made public last month. In the ruling,
Singer insisted that the employees had the freedom to choose what to do
on their breaks without having to notify their superiors and that the
lengths of the clock-outs were "left to the discretion of each
employee."  
The court ruled in favor of Singer, writing that "Swiss law does not
mention the right of employees to go to the toilet, even though this is
a basic physiological need."  
This "loophole" in Swiss labor law is not only being used by Singer but
by other companies in the watchmaking industry: Two companies in
Switzerland under the Swatch Group also required employees to clock out
for bathroom breaks.  
The parent firm said that it was unaware of this situation and ordered
its immediate end of the practice.
