Italy sent its first boat transporting migrants to Albania on Monday,
part of the country's five-year agreement to process asylum seekers in
detention centers in the state that is outside the European Union, and
an agreement that has sparked outrage from human rights groups, France24

Sixteen migrants from Egypt and Bangladesh had been rescued in
international waters by the Italian Coast Guard after departing Libya
for Italy,

ABC News.  
Instead of their asylum claims being processed in Italy, though, an
Italian ship named the Libra with the migrants on board left the Italian
island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean and headed for the Albanian
port of Shengjin.  
Last November, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Albanian Prime
Minister Edi Rama signed the deal which specified up to 3,000 migrants
picked up by the Italian Coast Guard would be sent to Albania each
month. The Libra was the first of these voyages.  
Rama said despite high demand from multiple countries in Europe, only
Italy is allowed to operate detention centers in Albania. An exception
was made for Italy due to the country's close ties with the country
across the Adriatic Sea, ABC News wrote.  
The migrants will be initially screened on board the Italian ships and
their cases will be more closely examined at the detention center in
Shengjin. Those migrants who are accepted will return to Italy. Those
rejected will be deported from Albania.  
Meanwhile, the Italian government has said that "vulnerable" migrants,
such as children, pregnant women, and the ill and the disabled, would be
processed in Italy. Only "non-vulnerable" men coming from "safe
countries" would be sent to the centers in Albania.  
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has endorsed the
agreement, citing it as an example of "out-of-box thinking,"
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/5HHnDwBfu2DzZNGG-O-XLg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo8hFUP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcTZzNnB4eWxjZS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1seDBnZGkxdzE4VwNzcGNCCmcOVowPZ7-MPw1SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to the New York Times.  
While being applauded by the Italian government and some European
leaders hoping to deter migration to the EU, the plan has also been
criticized by human rights groups who fear that such a plan puts
migrants at risk and exposes them to human rights violations.  
Susanna Zanfrini of the International Rescue Committee's office in Italy
criticized the detention centers for being "costly, cruel and
counterproductive," ABC reported.  
This is not the first time the EU has tried to "externalize" its
migration processing to non-EU states: It made a
[deal](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/4KcovipjMUC6qTdX1KaB9A~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo8hFUP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvbHZzazBqZm1qYi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1seDBnZGkxdzE4VwNzcGNCCmcOVowPZ7-MPw1SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
with Turkey in 2016 to slow migration into the bloc and accept deported
asylum seekers back into that country in exchange for about 9 billion
euros (\$10 billion).  
Meanwhile, the United Kingdom tried to implement a similar

with Rwanda, but it was halted by British courts.
