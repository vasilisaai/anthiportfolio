Tipping the Scales

Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema dismissed three of the country's
top judges for alleged judicial misconduct, raising questions about
judicial independence and political interference ahead of the 2026
presidential elections, the BBC

The three judges from the Constitutional Court were already suspended
and under investigation for political interference after dismissing
Hichilema's challenge against the election victory of former President
Edgar Lungu in 2016.  
The judges were also involved in a controversial ruling that allowed
Lungu to participate in the 2021 elections, despite having served as
Zambia's president twice, thereby violating term limits.  
Even so, Hichilema and Lungu are expected to run against each other for
the fourth time in 2026.  
The investigation into Justice Annie Sitali, Justice Mungeni Mulenga,
and Justice Palan Mulonda by the Judicial Complaints Commission (JCC)
over allegations of gross misconduct began after a complaint from a
private citizen.  
The JCC recommended their suspension, and they later lost a court
application for a review of the judicial panel's decision.  
Still, Hichilema's move to dismiss the judges has been criticized as
political.  
"My view is that the judges misbehaved spectacularly in the presidential
petition in 2016 ... (but) this comes across as the president exacting
revenge for their judgment which is highly concerning," Laura Miti, a
Zambian social and political commentator, told the BBC.  
The process of appointing judges in Zambia is led by the executive
branch and many analysts say that leads to the appointment of
unqualified or biased judges, and that the system needs to change to
improve the quality and independence of the judiciary.  
Hug It Out  
[NEW ZEALAND](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/4VyqzBf7CgUFSveVnHkqgg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo-0vXP0RlaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvMDk3M2V1aHp1ZS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1ucDQ2eXp1ZjJ2JmxoX2VtPWFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3MlNDBnbWFpbC5jb21XA3NwY0IKZxLYxhhn0cxKHFIaYW50aGkubGlraXRzYWtvc0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAFo~)  
A new measure in New Zealand limiting the length of hugs when dropping
loved ones off at the airport has ignited debate and outrage across the
country, the Washington Post
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/clJU963F9i68exqUME6Sww~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo-0vXP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvbTB1eHp6endyaS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1ucDQ2eXp1ZjJ2VwNzcGNCCmcS2MYYZ9HMShxSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Last month, the Dunedin airport on New Zealand's South Island
implemented a cap on hugs in the drop-off zone to reduce traffic during
peak travel times: A sign put up in the drop-off zone at the airport
reads, "Max hug time 3 minutes. For fonder farewells please use the
carpark."  
The airport serves the university town of 135,000 people, with fewer
than 1 million passengers passing through it annually, a fraction of the
tens of millions of people serviced by Chicago's O'Hare Airport or
London Heathrow.  
Even so, traffic backs up, say officials.  
Dan de Bono, the Dunedin airport's chief executive, said that warning
messages at other airport drop-off zones can include threats of fines or
clamping wheels, something Dunedin wanted to avoid,

the Guardian.  
"We're trying to have fun with it," he told the newspaper. "It is an
airport and those drop-off locations are common locations for
farewells."  
But many New Zealanders aren't amused. Thousands criticized the rule on
a Facebook post that went viral, saying that putting a cap on hug time
was unreasonable and even inhumane, according to the Guardian.  
De Bono added that Dunedin Airport has no plans to strictly enforce the
time limit -- although he joked about deploying "hug police," the Post
wrote.  
Meanwhile, many think that the allotted time, three minutes, is quite
generous. At busy airports in the United States, it's sometimes
prohibited to even stop to say goodbye, some on social media noted.  
Even so, while De Bono admitted that three minutes is not the world's
most generous hug limit -- Nice airport in France allows five minutes --
he demonstrated a shorter hug in front of staff and reporters, quoting a
study that suggested a 20-second hug is long enough to release oxytocin,
the love hormone.  
But Michael Banissy, the head of psychological science at the United
Kingdom's University of Bristol, said on Monday that "for some people,
time limits might undermine the natural, comforting nature of hugging,
potentially preventing individuals from fully experiencing a farewell
hug's emotional and physiological rewards,"
