Around 200 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti's capital
Port-au-Prince in a massacre ordered by a powerful gang leader who
targeted Voodoo practitioners and the elderly in a personal vendetta,

to the Guardian.  
The National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) said on Sunday that
gang leader Monel "Mikano" Felix ordered the massacre in Cite Soleil,
one of the capital's poorest and most violent neighborhoods, after his
son died from an illness,

Jazeera.  
At least 110 people were killed in Cite Soleil on Saturday and Sunday by
gang members using machetes and knives, most of them over the age of 60,
according to the rights group. Felix had reportedly sought advice from a
Voodoo priest who told him that elderly people in the area were using
witchcraft to harm his child.  
Voodoo was brought to Haiti by enslaved people from Africa and is now a
pillar of Haitian culture. It includes aspects of other religious
beliefs, such as Catholicism, but has been villainized by other
religions, noted the Guardian.  
"He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and Vodou practitioners
who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his
son," read a statement from the Haiti-based Committee for Peace and
Development (CPD). "The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying
victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be
executed."  
According to the United Nations, about 5,000 people have been killed in
Haiti so far this year and an estimated 700,000 people have been
displaced, half of them children.  
Although Haiti has suffered from decades of instability, the situation
escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in
the capital to overthrow the prime minister, Ariel Henry. The interim
government has been plagued by political infighting, leaving the country
without a clear path to stability in the wake of gang violence and a
severe humanitarian crisis.  
A UN-backed security force, led by Kenya, has been deployed to restore
order, although gangs controlling 80 percent of the capital have made it
difficult for them to make progress. The mission, based on voluntary
contributions, is also severely underfunded and only partially deployed,
according to Al Jazeera.  
Haitian leaders have called for the mission to be converted into a UN
peacekeeping force to ensure it is better supplied, but the plan faces
opposition from China and Russia.
