Two Americans held in Afghanistan were released on Tuesday in exchange
for a Taliban member imprisoned for life in California on drug
trafficking and terrorism charges, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/E0h4Qj03yJg0VwCcs874nA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpc1JjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZ3ZnNzk2Yjc2cy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD12ZHJiejk1dGd4VwNzcGNCCmeOY82QZ-tFSsRSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The two Americans, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, were exchanged for
Afghani Taliban member Khan Mohammed, 55, who was convicted in 2008 on
narco-terrorism charges and sentenced to two life sentences,
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/C9GGImX601dhd0Qzd7YA4A~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpc1JjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvM3N3eW40YXQwNC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD12ZHJiejk1dGd4VwNzcGNCCmeOY82QZ-tFSsRSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to CNN.  
Corbett had lived in Afghanistan at the time of the 2021 collapse of the
US-backed government and was taken by the Taliban while on a business
trip in 2022.  
The prisoner swap was organized by the Biden administration -- which
oversaw the controversial US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 --
after nearly two years of Qatari-mediated negotiations between
Washington and the Taliban.  
Meanwhile, Mohammed arrived back in his home province of Nangarhar, in
the east of Afghanistan. He had been the first person to be convicted
under US narco-terrorism laws.  
He was indicted in 2006 and brought to the US in 2007. During his trial,
he was accused of helping the Taliban obtain rockets to attack a US
military base and selling heroin intended to be distributed in the
states,
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/ibcuaGMNO_9wMn1Zub5rjQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpc1JjP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvdHl4dHR4Njk3dy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD12ZHJiejk1dGd4VwNzcGNCCmeOY82QZ-tFSsRSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to the New York Times.  
The Taliban praised the swap as a step towards the "normalization" of
ties between the two nations, although most countries still don't
recognize Taliban rule.  
Even so, two other Americans are being held hostage by the Taliban,
according to US officials.  
The Taliban have been trying to receive international recognition
following their takeover of the country in 2021. Afghanistan is
grappling with a struggling economy and financial shortfalls since the
takeover after billions in international funds were frozen and thousands
of highly skilled Afghans fled the country.
