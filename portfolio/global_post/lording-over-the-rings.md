Lording Over the Rings  
FRANCE 
Paris' triumphant hosting of the Olympics this summer has turned into a
political fight over the Games' most well-known symbol, with the French
capital's mayor determined to keep the rings on the city's most iconic
landmark, the Eiffel Tower, for the next four years, Politico

Paris' Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she wants to keep the multicolor rings on
the tower until the next Olympic Games in Los Angeles in four years. But
opponents countered that it's a political ploy ahead of elections in two
years, when Hidalgo will face former minister of culture, Rachida Dati,
for the city's top job.  
David Alphand, a city councilor and ally of Dati said the rings would
serve to remind voters of the success of the city, which was one of
about a half-dozen French towns, in hosting the Games.  
Meanwhile, the descendants of the engineer who constructed the tower,
Gustave Eiffel, are furious over the plan, saying they will take legal
action to preserve the integrity of the original work. "(The rings
don't) respect the work of our ancestor," Olivier Berthelot-Eiffel, a
great-great-grandson of Gustave Eiffel,

or for commercial purposes, but anything adorning the landmark has
always been temporary.  
Now, Hidalgo maintains that the decision is up to the city but says she
has backup from the International Olympic Committee, BBC News

Regardless, the rings, weighing 30 tons, are too heavy for the
structure. The mayor wants them replaced with lighter versions.
