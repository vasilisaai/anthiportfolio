Moldova has narrowly voted to join the European Union in a referendum
and an election marked by allegations of heavy-handed interference by
Russia, even as the Kremlin complained Monday of election fraud,

With 99.4 percent of votes counted in the EU referendum, the "Yes" vote
took 50.4 percent and the "No" vote won 49.6 percent, according to the
Central Electoral Commission. The referendum on Sunday specifically
asked voters whether to enshrine a path toward EU membership in the
country's constitution.  
President Maia Sandu, who wants to steer the country away from Russia
since being elected in 2020, said the results symbolized Moldova's first
step toward joining the bloc.  
The former Soviet Republic began talks to join the bloc in June,
propelled by Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Surveys ahead of
the referendum showed that around 55 percent of Moldovans would support
joining the EU while 34 percent were against it, [according

However, the win for "Yes" was razor thin, with votes from Moldova's
large and mostly pro-EU diaspora trickling in at the last moment,

Sandu also failed to receive enough votes to win in the presidential
election held the same day. A second round of voting will be held on
Nov. 3.  
Meanwhile, Sandu accused "criminal groups" of engaging in election
fraud. She added that these groups were backed by foreign forces trying
to "undermine (the) democratic process."  
Earlier this month, Moldovan police foiled an "unprecedented" Russian
plot to meddle in the elections, raiding numerous locations where they
discovered \$15 million that they allege Russia was using [to

Vandals spraypainted the country's Supreme Court, the state-run
broadcaster, and the Ministry for Labor and Social Protection, for
example.  
The Kremlin has denied such allegations. Meanwhile, Russian officials on
Monday said the election was "not free" and pointed suspicion over to "a
hard-to-explain" rate of increase of votes in favor of Sandu and in
support of the "yes" campaign, Reuters

However, EU officials backed the Moldova president. "This vote took
place under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and
its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes in the
Republic of Moldova," said Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the European
Commission.
