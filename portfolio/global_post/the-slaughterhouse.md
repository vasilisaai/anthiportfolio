A case in South Africa, where two black women were murdered and fed to
pigs on a white-owned farm, has sparked outrage and protests across the
country, while also reigniting a debate over the issues of race and land
ownership in the country, the New York Times

On Tuesday, protests broke out outside of a court in Polokwane where
three men have been accused of killing the two women, who were
scavenging for food. The accused include the White farm owner and two
employees, one of whom is White,

They are accused of shooting Maria Makgatho, 44, and Lucia Ndlovu, 35,
who were hunting for food on a farm in the Limpopo Province, northeast
of Johannesburg near Polokwane in mid-August. Afterward, the three men
allegedly attempted to hide the bodies by dumping them in a pigsty.  
Police found the victims' bodies decomposed and partly eaten.  
Makgatho's husband was also shot but survived to detail the shooting,
prosecutors said.  
The farm was well known to surrounding community residents as a place to
go for discarded food. Makgatho and Ndlovu had allegedly trespassed on
the farm after a truck from a dairy company dumped expired goods
there.  
Violent crimes on South Africa's farms have been a concern for years,
including violence and abuse against the farmers themselves. White
farmers say that they have been targets of attacks by intruders and that
their lives are often threatened, the Associated Press wrote.  
Meanwhile, the case has renewed a date on land disparity and wealth
inequality in South Africa following apartheid: Then, many Black South
Africans were forced from their land. Currently, most farms remain under
White ownership. Also, many Black South Africans in rural areas still
live in poverty, resulting in the need to scavenge for food on farms.
