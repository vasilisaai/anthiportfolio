The United Kingdom on Thursday agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands to
Mauritius, ending a decades-long dispute over the Indian Ocean
archipelago that is home to a strategic US-UK military base, Politico
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/TFiLUusayaZCvnENz3Bfcg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo4j9VP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZGY2djRsZDJuZy8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD15N3B3bjl6OXN3VwNzcGNCCmb3V7r_ZlELeERSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
On Thursday, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and his Mauritian
counterpart Pravind Jugnauth announced a "seminal moment" in their
political agreement over the archipelago's future.  
Under the deal, the UK will return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius,
except for the island of Diego Garcia which houses a US base for naval
ships and long-range bomber aircraft.  
Diego Garcia Island will remain under US and UK jurisdiction for at
least the next 99 years.  
The agreement will also see Mauritius implement a program of
resettlement, while the UK will provide a financial support package to
boost development in the archipelago.  
In a joint statement, the two countries said the agreement "will address
wrongs of the past and demonstrate the commitment of both parties to
support the welfare of Chagossians."  
The dispute over the archipelago dates back to the 1960s.  
Mauritius has argued that it was forced to give up the islands after it
became independent from the UK in 1968. The UK expelled between 1,500
and 2,000 Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s so that it could lease
Diego Garcia Island to the US for military use.  
The two allies have jointly operated the base there since that period,

to the Guardian.  
The recent agreement follows rounds of negotiations that began in 2022,
three years after the International Court of Justice issued an [advisory
opinion](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/XuLihSi_1DCMS_jUT-EGpQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo4j9VP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcXh3OG1xb25ieC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD15N3B3bjl6OXN3VwNzcGNCCmb3V7r_ZlELeERSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
that the UK had unlawfully separated the Chagos Islands from
Mauritius.  
The court said the UK was "under an obligation to bring to an end its
administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible."  
The previous Conservative government had rejected calls to return the
islands, countering that the ICJ's ruling was only an advisory
opinion.  
Despite receiving support from the current Labour government and the
United States, the decision to cede the archipelago sparked criticism
from the Conservative opposition in the UK.  
Shadow Security Minister Tom Tugendhat, who is running for the
Conservative party leadership, argued that the move "compromises both
our national security and the stability of the region."  
The Chagossian community also remained divided over the agreement, with
some saying they would have preferred self-determination to being under
the jurisdiction of Mauritius.  
Chagossian Voices, a community organization for Chagossians based in the
UK and other countries, admonished the British government for failing to
consult with the islanders before making the agreement.
