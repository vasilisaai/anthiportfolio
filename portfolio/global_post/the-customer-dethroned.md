gotten so out of hand that Tokyo is putting them on notice, the Japan

Earlier this month, the city passed the country's first ordinance to
help protect workers from harassment, a move aimed at addressing the
rising incidence of abuse of service industry staff by customers, also
seen as gods or kings in the country.  
Tokyo officials said the directive will go into effect in April. While
it does not carry penalties, the government hopes it will send a message
to customers to stop taking their frustrations out on employees, the

Officials plan to develop more detailed guidelines before April, but
Governor Yuriko Koike said the main philosophy of the order is "mutual
respect between workers and customers."  
Japanese society is known for its attention to manners, as well as its
exceptional customer service. But recently, customer behavior has gotten
so extreme that it has threatened the safety of service workers,
officials said. There has been an increase by customers in verbal abuse,
violence, and doxing on social media of service sector employees.  
A June survey by UA Zense, a federation of labor unions in the Japanese
retail and service industries, discovered that almost one in two
respondents experienced some form of customer harassment in the past two
years.  
The harassment has also crept into local government offices: One
official complained to a local newspaper that some people "feel they can
say whatever they want when dealing with public servants because they
are paying tax."  
Meanwhile, three other prefectures are considering similar laws. Some
municipalities and companies in Japan have also been giving employees
the option of displaying only their first names on ID badges to increase
employee anonymity.  
Hiromi Ikeuchi, a sociology professor at Kansai University, said the
rise of *kasuhara *(customer harassment) is influenced by various
factors, including the tendency to treat customers as "gods" in the
fight to remain profitable in an increasingly challenging business
climate -- an approach that has shifted the balance of power from
companies to their customers.
