Kazakh voters have overwhelmingly approved the building of the country's
first nuclear power plant to replace its coal-fired power production in
a landmark referendum over the weekend that was criticized for being a
rubber stamp for the government's plan, the Diplomat
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/HJctkVbeynMlxAbvf60hCA~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo6NbSP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvNHd6Zzg3ZWtoei8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05cGJzbnc2bWlkVwNzcGNCCmcF1FEGZ4zPVhpSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
About 71 percent of voters approved the plant, backed by President
Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in a referendum Sunday, according to results
released by Kazakhstan's Central Referendum Commission on Tuesday, the
Astana Times
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/Ls3RwZnbGNfOAub2GjhR8g~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo6NbSP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvdWw2MTdqNzc0bi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05cGJzbnc2bWlkVwNzcGNCCmcF1FEGZ4zPVhpSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Meanwhile, there were some irregularities

the vote such as "ballot stuffing" and the removal of independent
observers, the Diplomat wrote.  
The government wants to build a nuclear plant in the southeastern
village of Ulken on the shores of Lake Balkhash, in an attempt to lessen
the country's reliance on highly polluting coal plants.  
The government says that nuclear power can provide a net zero-carbon
solution to Kazakhstan's growing power deficit, especially since the
country is one of the world's biggest uranium producers.  
However, the plan has faced public criticism due to fears over the
potential dangers of nuclear power that stem from previous Soviet
nuclear tests in the country, and suspicions that Russian contractors
might be a part of the project, [according

Many Kazakhs want to reduce Russia's influence over Kazakhstan.  
Many also criticized the high cost of the project -- estimated at around
\$12 billion -- adding that gas-fired plants are less expensive and less
risky.  
When part of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan was the site of hundreds of
Soviet nuclear weapons tests that made large parts of land uninhabitable
and impacted the health of nearby residents, as well as the 1986
Chernobyl power plant disaster having made the public wary of nuclear
power.  
One of the four contractors whose reactors are being considered for the
power plant project is Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear plant operator.
The public is skeptical of Russian involvement because of its history
and also sanctions on Russian energy.  
Tokayev reiterated that there was no single company or country in mind
as a potential contractor when he cast his vote in the referendum
publicly in the capital Astana,

Tokayev also said that holding this referendum is in line with his
"Listening State" concept -- listening to the people's wants and
needs.  
Still, the country is

and anti-nuclear protesters have been impeded from demonstrating in
cities across the country, with some activists detained or facing
fines.  
"The decision to build the nuclear power plant, and to build it with
Rosatom, has already been made in (Tokayev's office) and the people of
Kazakhstan are being invited to polling stations as 'notaries' to
authenticate this decision with their votes," popular blogger Vadim
Boreiko

Still, some locals hoped the project would bring jobs. "I support the
power plant," Dametken Shulgeyeva, who has lived in the small town of
Ulken for more than 20 years, told Reuters. "This is our future."
