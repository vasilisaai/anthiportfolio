The Toxic Shroud  
INDIA/PAKISTAN 
Cities in India and Pakistan saw unprecedented levels of thick, toxic
smog this week, leading officials to close schools, keep workers home
and request residents wear masks, CNN

The Air Quality Index has surpassed 1,000 in Lahore, Pakistan and

the 500 mark in Delhi, India. Anything above 301 on the index is
considered hazardous and causes serious health effects such as heart and
lung conditions and eye and throat irritation.  
"This is a critical situation," said Marriyum Aurangzeb, a senior
minister in Punjab, adding that the smog could linger for another 10
days.  
Thousands of people have been admitted to hospitals because of
respiratory issues in the past week in Punjab, many of them children.  
The pollution in the region has been so pronounced that it can be seen
from space. Earlier this week, NASA satellite images showed a blanket of
smog engulfing parts of northern India and neighboring Pakistan.  
Most years, crop burning in northern India and Pakistan contributes to
poor air quality in October and November, along with other human
activities such as vehicle emissions, industry, and cooking fires.  
Responding to the crisis, authorities in Pakistan also banned the use of
outdoor grills that use wood or coal, impounded vehicles, and ordered
motorized rickshaws off the roads. In Lahore, the authorities have
ordered half of all workers to stay home.  
Meanwhile, the Delhi government enacted its Graded Response Action Plan
that bans all activities that involve the use of coal, diesel
generators, and firewood. They urged residents to stay indoors and use
public transport to reduce vehicle emissions,

Still, 81 percent of families reported at least one member suffering
from health issues due to pollution in the last week, according to a
survey on an online community platform.  
Analysts have attributed the rising pollution levels to rapid
industrialization and weak enforcement of environmental laws, and argued
that the governments must find long-term solutions.
