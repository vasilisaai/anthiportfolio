Peace in Pieces  
[COLOMBIA](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/FMdI3nPzNz_lDWLuYkCIxQ~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpcgDgP0RlaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvd3JsMTR1cGdybC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1ob3FnbHNrNHBuJmxoX2VtPWFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3MlNDBnbWFpbC5jb21XA3NwY0IKZ47ge49n-LQRF1IaYW50aGkubGlraXRzYWtvc0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAFo~)  
More than 80 people were killed in attacks by the National Liberation
Army (ELN) in northeastern Colombia over the weekend, an offensive that
came after the government suspended peace talks with the rebels,
accusing them of war crimes, Al Jazeera
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/IEsP-Rb_z0cobFfNl7Tvwg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpcgDgP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvMzFiNG5iN2NxbC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1ob3FnbHNrNHBuVwNzcGNCCmeO4HuPZ_i0ERdSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The attacks began late last week in the Catatumbo region with the ELN
targeting a splinter group of the now-defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia--People's Army (FARC), which was disarmed after a peace
agreement in 2016.  
The attacks happened in several towns near the Colombian border with
Venezuela. Among the victims are community leader Carmelo Guerrero and
seven people who wanted to sign a peace deal, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/Fp0ylrZRdH0Ru248GidN7g~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpcgDgP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvdjQ0NHZmbjdrZC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1ob3FnbHNrNHBuVwNzcGNCCmeO4HuPZ_i0ERdSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).
Many of the victims were civilians caught in the crossfire between the
two rebel groups.  
Meanwhile, thousands of people have been displaced by the fighting even
as the Colombian military scrambled to evacuate residents on Sunday, the
AP wrote. The army said it sent more than 5,000 troops to the region to
"reinforce security."  
The ELN and the former FARC rebels have been fighting over control of a
strategic border region that has coca plantations.  
The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of a number of killings in the area
and warned the rebels that if they continued attacking the population,
there would be an armed confrontation.  
The deadly attack comes after the Colombian government suspended peace
talks with the ELN for the second time in less than a year on Friday.  
The ELN and the administration of President Gustavo Petro have tried to
negotiate a peace deal five times, but talks continue to break down over
a demand by the ELN to be recognized as a political organization.  
Petro, who has been pushing a policy of "total peace" in the South
American country, called off the recent negotiations with the ELN,
saying "the ELN has no will for peace."
