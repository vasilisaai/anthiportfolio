Extra Shifts  
[CHINA]  
China will raise the retirement age next year, a move aimed at
addressing the demographic challenges in a country where the current age
for workers to retire is one of the lowest in the world, the BBC
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/f9n_Se3KosbwEz1Jnq2Vmw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRoyoRVP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvOHRvZnF0NDY5eC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1rdGhtZ3Ywa21hVwNzcGNCCmbhV__nZo9RTUlSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Under current laws, Chinese men can retire at the age of 60, while women
could stop working as early as 50.  
But the new regulations will raise the statutory retirement age to 63
for men and 55 for women in blue-collar jobs. The retirement age for
women in white-collar jobs will increase from 55 to 58.  
Starting in January 2025, the changes will affect millions of workers,
with the respective retirement ages raised every few months over the
next 15 years.  
The plan will require younger generations to work even longer: By 2039,
workers will need to contribute to the pension system for 20 years to be
eligible for benefits, up from the current 15 years,

to the Wall Street Journal.  
The reform comes amid concerns regarding the sustainability of China's
pension system in the face of a rapidly aging population. China's
pension fund may run out of funds by 2035, according to a 2019 report
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.  
At the same time, the country is grappling with a demographic decline as
a result of low birth rates, an aging population and the effects of the
decades-long one-child policy -- the latter was scrapped in 2016. It has
moved to promote marriage and children, recently tightening rules on
abortion access and divorce.  
The upcoming changes sparked criticism from Chinese workers, both young
and middle-aged. Some netizens also complained about older generations
still occupying jobs, while many younger workers struggle to find
employment.  
Youth unemployment reached more than 17 percent in July 2023.  
Even so, others viewed the changes as inevitable, noting higher
retirement ages in other major economies, such as the United States and
those in Western Europe, where male workers typically retire around the
ages of 65 to 67.  
Analysts said the reform is necessary to maintain productivity because
it would allow educated and skilled workers to continue contributing to
the workforce. But others warned that the gradual approach to increasing
the retirement age is too slow, postponing the political and economic
burden on future generations.
