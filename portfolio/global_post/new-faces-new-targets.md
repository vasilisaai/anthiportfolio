The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero
was killed over the weekend less than a week after he took office, one
of almost three dozen murders of politicians in the past six months, CNN
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/5USSpK31N4Z6MhQ7o-uAng~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo6NbSP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcjN1M3Iycjd6ei8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05cGJzbnc2bWlkVwNzcGNCCmcF1FEGZ4zPVhpSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Alejandro Arcos Catalán, 43, was found dead on Oct. 6, five days after
taking office in the city of Chilpancingo. Local media
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/vV7HngyG1EW5DQlgqtdBmw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo6NbSP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsveHQ1ZGczdGVwNC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05cGJzbnc2bWlkVwNzcGNCCmcF1FEGZ4zPVhpSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
that he had been decapitated, with his head left on his car, a claim
that was not confirmed.  
His murder followed that of Chilpancingo's general secretary, Francisco
Tapia, who was killed a few days before.  
Chilpancingo has been at the center of rival cartels trying to
infiltrate and control the local economy. The cartels favor candidates
willing to make deals and grant them immunity for their crimes. Arcos

he was not so inclined.  
Even so, criminal gangs often finance campaigns during election season,
intimidating candidates and violently intervening to compel politicians
to cooperate with them, CNN wrote.  
Arcos was elected representing an opposition coalition that included the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, CBS News
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/2u5b4Kb8rdhRKlTc2a76jg~~/AASU4wA~/RgRo6NbSP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZHp1ZGY5enB4Mi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD05cGJzbnc2bWlkVwNzcGNCCmcF1FEGZ4zPVhpSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).
The party denounced his killing on the social media platform X, writing
"Enough of violence and impunity! The people of Guerrero do not deserve
to live in fear."  
However, the killing was just the latest targeting politicians both in
the run-up to the June 2 election and since, an election deemed the
largest -- but also the bloodiest -- in Mexican history.  
During the campaign season, at least 34 political candidates were
assassinated by crime gangs. Meanwhile, hours after the election results
were announced on June 3, Yolanda Sánchez Figueroa, mayor of Cotija in
Michoacán state, was also murdered.  
Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's new president who was inaugurated on Oct. 1,
called the incident "unfortunate" and said that she would soon unveil
the details of her cabinet's plan to address national security and
cartel violence in the coming days.
