Just Saying 'No'

A Zimbabwean high court judge has ruled that a law prohibiting abortion
access for girls under the age of 18 and women raped by their husbands
is unconstitutional, a landmark ruling for the conservative and
struggling country, the Associated Press
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/-ioYGCn73hgsdHDk_69b1g~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpMrjmP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcXBxcTA2N2Y0aS8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1sdnU2cWJweWlyVwNzcGNCCmdG5zNQZxqBdN1SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
High Court Judge Maxwell Takuva issued a ruling on Nov. 22, which was
made public last week, saying that since Zimbabwe's laws criminalize
marital rape and sex with minors, victims should have the lawful right
to abortion if they become pregnant.  
"There is no doubt that it is torture, cruel, and degrading treatment
for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another
child, or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel
circumstances," said Takuva.  
Zimbabwe has had restrictive abortion laws that often lead women to seek
out illegal abortions which in many cases turn fatal. Almost 80,000
unsafe abortions occur every year in the country of 15 million people,
while thousands of others go unreported, the newswire wrote.  
Legal abortions have previously been allowed in Zimbabwe only if the
pregnancy endangers the life of the mother if there is a risk of a
physical or mental birth defect, or in cases of unlawful sex such as
incest.  
In September, Zimbabwe criminalized sex with those under the age of 18,
but the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied
abortion services to minors before the ruling. The current case, brought
by a women's rights group, has faced no governmental opposition but
still needs to be approved by Zimbabwe's Supreme Court to take effect as
law.  
Judge Takuva also said that providing access to safe abortions for
teenage girls "is significant in light of the massive instances of
teenage pregnancies in Zimbabwe, and consequently illegal teen abortions
and teenage mortalities."

females becomes pregnant between the ages of 10 and 19 in Zimbabwe due
to the lax enforcement of laws protecting young girls, cultural and
religious practices, and widespread poverty that makes it hard to access
contraceptives and clinics.  
In this deeply conservative country, one in three females is married
before the age of 18. In cases of underage sex and unplanned
pregnancies, families and officials try "to sweep the cases under the
carpet or ... force marriages on the minor," police spokesman Paul
Nyathi told the newswire.
