Montenegro is observing three days of national mourning after 12 people,
including two children, were killed on New Year's Day in a rare mass
shooting in the town of Cetinje,
[according](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/V0nkliZwzQLunhwdNKs1Yw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpWkXhP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvcmNoMDY5ejd3ci8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD0wM2t5aDk5djcxVwNzcGNCCmdl4sB3Z6whey9SGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa)
to BBC News.  
Authorities said the suspect, 45-year-old Aco Martinović, had been
drinking heavily all day and got into an argument with another guest at
a restaurant on the evening of Jan. 1.  
Following the argument, Martinović went home and later returned to the
restaurant with a gun, killing several people, including the owner of
the restaurant and his two children, ages 10 and 13. Martinović then
drove to five other locations in the Cetinje area and shot several more
people, including members of his own family.  
Afterward, the alleged shooter fled but was located and surrounded by
police after an hours-long manhunt. He died en route to hospital after
shooting himself in the head, Interior Minister Danilo Šaranović said,

to the Associated Press.  
This is the second incident of a mass shooting in the town, Montenegro's
historical capital, in the past three years. Another man shot and killed
10 people, including children, following a family dispute in 2022,
reported the AP.  
After the latest shooting, the government has declared three days of
national mourning and canceled all planned New Year's festivities
throughout the small Balkan country. Prime Minister Milojko Spajić said
the shooting had "shrouded our country in black."  
The prime minister also said that the country's security council would
hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to "urgently consider all options"
to protect the public from similar events, including a complete ban on
weapons.  
He added that "because we must ask ourselves after this who should be
allowed to have guns in Montenegro," according to the wire.  
While mass shootings are still relatively uncommon in Montenegro, the
nation has a strong gun culture, and many individuals possess weapons.
