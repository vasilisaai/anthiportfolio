More than 120 people were killed in a high-magnitude earthquake in the
mountainous region of Tibet in western China on Tuesday, with tremors
being felt across the Himalayas and rescue missions working in freezing
conditions to aid isolated communities, CNN
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/9wGrS0cDuDF_4XqiD0x_Nw~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpYN1lP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsveWg4OWtwbjdmOC8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1td2NvaWVyYzRoVwNzcGNCCmd4Zlh-ZwgCcgJSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
The 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck at 9:05 local time at a depth of 6.2
miles in Dingri county, along the Himalayan border with Nepal. It was
followed by multiple aftershocks, with tremors felt in neighboring
Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of northern India.  
More than 1,000 houses experienced some form of damage in Dingri, where
the average altitude is around 15,000 feet,

to the New York Times. It is not yet clear how many residents have been
left homeless by the quake.  
Frantic rescue efforts were being conducted without heavy equipment,
highlighting the challenge of delivering critical aid and resources to
isolated communities in the region. Rescue workers face the pressure of
time to locate survivors, as the temperatures in the region are as low
as 5 Fahrenheit.  
The Tibetan holy city of Shigatse was the nearest major city to the
epicenter of the earthquake and is home to about 800,000 people, noted
CNN. The city is home to the centuries-old Tashilhunpo Monastery, the
traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest spiritual
leader in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama. No damage to the
monastery has been so far reported.  
Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered officials to minimize casualties
and resettle survivors after the disaster. Around 3,400 rescuers and
more than 340 medical workers were deployed for the search effort,
equipped with tents, winter coats, quilts, and folding beds for
survivors.  
Tibet is one of the most underdeveloped and inaccessible parts of China.
Robert Barnett, a professor from the School of Oriental and African
Studies in London, told the New York Times that rescue efforts might be
affected by damaged roads, describing the region as a "vast
moonscape".  
Barnett also noted that the roads are "quite few and susceptible to
landslides."  
Security in the region has also been heightened for decades because of
tensions between the Chinese government and Tibetans, who have long
struggled to maintain their religious and cultural freedom in the
country. International journalists are forbidden from traveling
independently in the area.
