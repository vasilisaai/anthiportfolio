Midwife Crisis

The Taliban in Afghanistan banned women from attending courses training
them to be midwives and nurses, blocking women's last route to higher
education and creating a dire health threat in the country, the BBC
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/TLTfOGjwrg1km5Ad_cZF1w~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpNVvmP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvZzNqMW4yODY5bi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD1haWlpaWtrMWZmVwNzcGNCCmdG5tZSZxifYBdSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
This week, five private medical training institutions across Afghanistan
confirmed to the BBC that the Taliban had instructed them to close
indefinitely.  
Women also reported being ordered not to return to their classes the
following day. Videos circulated online of some students weeping at the
news, as well as others singing in defiance as they left the training
colleges. Women were recently banned from raising their voices.  
"They even told us not to stand in the courtyard because the Taliban
could arrive at any moment, and something might happen. Everyone was
terrified," one student told the BBC. "For many of us, attending classes
was a small glimmer of hope after long periods of unemployment,
depression, and isolation at home."  
Since the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021, females
cannot attend school after the sixth grade. The Taliban had promised to
readmit girls into school once issues with the system were resolved, for
example ensuring the curriculum was "Islamic," but to date they have not
kept this promise. As a result, 2.5 million females are missing from
schools and universities, the United Nations

Training to be nurses or midwives in further education colleges was one
of the few avenues still open to women seeking higher education and a
career. Officials in the Ministry of Public Health successfully lobbied
Taliban officials in February of 2024 to allow women to obtain nursing
and midwife training,

One motivation for this exception to the banning of higher education for
women was that females are not allowed to receive medical treatment from
male medics without a male guardian present.  
Now, this new decree will have a dire impact on maternal health and
women's health in general, in a country with one of the worst maternal
mortality rates in the world, Human Rights Watch

"This new decree ... will result in unnecessary pain, misery, sickness,
and death for the women forced to go without health care,"

About 17,000 women were enrolled in the courses. Meanwhile, a UN report
last year

that Afghanistan needed an additional 18,000 midwives to meet the
country's needs.  
"This is bad news for all Afghan people," one student, turned away from
her classes, told NPR. "Because men cannot become midwives in
Afghanistan."
