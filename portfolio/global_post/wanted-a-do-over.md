Georgia launched a partial vote recount Tuesday, just days after the
country's president and the opposition called for mass protests and the
annulment of the election after results showed the ruling Georgian Dream

Georgian Dream won nearly 54 percent of the vote, according to Georgian
election officials. However, pro-Western opposition parties rejected the
outcome, calling it "illegitimate" and alleging Russian interference.  
A group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had uncovered
evidence of complex, large-scale fraud and demanded an annulment of at
least 15 percent of the votes cast.  
Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, a former Georgian Dream ally
who became a member of the opposition, called on Sunday for people to
take to the streets to protest the results, saying the vote was a
"Russian special operation," Reuters

Zourabichvili appealed to the international community, adding that the
results "do not correspond to the will of the Georgian people."  
The opposition has accused Georgian Dream of trying to steer the
Caucasus country away from its goal of joining the European Union, a
goal supported by a majority of Georgians, who viewed the election as a
make-or-break referendum on the matter,

On Monday, tens of thousands of Georgians wielding EU and Georgian flags
protested outside the Georgian parliament in the capital Tbilisi,

Following the demonstrations, the District Election Commission (DEC)
announced it would hold a partial vote recount and "conduct recounts of
ballots from five polling stations randomly selected in each election
district."  
However, the opposition and the protesters have called for "fresh"
elections run by an "international election administration."  
The EU, NATO and the United States have all called for a full
investigation into the alleged electoral fraud.

Iran executed 69-year-old German-Iranian political scientist Jamshid
Sharmahd on Monday, sparking outrage in Germany and across the globe,
the Guardian
[reported](https://post.spmailtechnol.com/f/a/C9abFeTcM_zdX0AFVzTFww~~/AASU4wA~/RgRpBIZVP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9hLnBvc3QubGhkLmxpbmsvaDF3dmNueHlqdi8_bGhfYWlkPTExNDUwJmxoX2NpZD10YTVoc2Rudm04VwNzcGNCCmcSVgEiZ8xPbDJSGmFudGhpLmxpa2l0c2Frb3NAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAABa).  
Sharmahd, an Iran-born German citizen residing in the United States, was
accused of orchestrating a deadly bombing in Iran in 2008. He was also
accused of leading the Tondar group, which Iran classifies as a
terrorist organization aiming to overthrow the Islamic Republic.  
According to his family, Iranian officials seized Sharmahd when he was
traveling via the United Arab Emirates in 2020. Iran law enforcement
claimed at the time they had captured him in a "complex operation," but
did not provide other details.  
Sharmahd was sentenced to death in February 2023, for the offense of
"corruption on earth," which carries the death penalty, which was later
confirmed by the Iranian supreme court. Sharmahd and his family
maintained his innocence, with human rights groups and Western
governments condemning his trial as a sham,

the New York Times.  
While Iran has executed many opponents of the government, the case of
Sharmahd drew international attention because of his German citizenship
and residency in the US.  
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the execution "shows once
again what kind of inhumane regime rules in Tehran: a regime that uses
death against its youth, its own population, and foreign nationals." She
added that "the execution of a German national would have serious
consequences."  
The case has garnered attention from human rights groups such as the
Norway-based group Iran Human Rights (IHR), which called the execution
of Sharmahd "a case of extrajudicial killing of a hostage aimed at
covering up the recent failures of the hostage-takers of the Islamic
Republic."  
Iran has executed at least 627 people this year, according to IHR.  
Rights groups have accused Iran of using capital punishment as a tool to
instill fear in society,

A number of other Europeans are still being held captive in Iran.
European Parliament lawmaker member Hannah Neumann, who chairs the Iran
delegation, called for a total change of the European Union's policy
towards the Iranian government following this incident.
